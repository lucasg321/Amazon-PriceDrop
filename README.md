# Amazon-PriceDrop
Track an Amazon product price and receive a notification -- Python

The Amazon Price Drop application tracks a user inputted product available on Amazon by checking the price of the product every x amount of minutes, where x is a value inputted by the user. If the price drops below its original price, then the application sends a text message to notify the user. Made with Python, Twilio, tkinter and unittest. While this is a very simple application, I decided to create it in part due to its practical use case, but also because I added an extra challenge for myself during development -- namely, that I would utilize software engineering best practices. For example, I strove to create extremely clean and well commented code and object oriented design principles when applicable. To top it off, I created unit tests for testing the main functions of the application, such as the product API requests and setting user inputted values from text boxes. While the application is simple in scope, the real learning experience was the software engineering best practices that went into its development.
